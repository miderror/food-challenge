## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.
-   Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-link>`
-   Navigate to the project directory: `cd food-challenge`

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill it with your credentials.

```env
# Django
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_strong_secret_key

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Telegram Bot

### 3. Running the Project

The project uses a `Makefile` for convenient command execution.

#### Development

1.  **Build and run all services:**
    ```bash
    make dev-up
    ```
2.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    make dev-migrate
    ```
3.  **Create an admin user:**
    ```bash
    make dev-superuser
    ```
    *The admin panel will be available at `http://localhost/admin/`.*

4.  **(Optional) Seed the database with products:**
    ```bash
    make dev-seed-products
    ```

#### Other useful commands:
-   `make dev-logs s=bot`: View real-time logs for a service (e.g., `bot`, `backend`).
-   `make dev-down`: Stop and remove all running containers.

#### Production

For production deployment, use the `prod-*` commands (`make prod-up`, `make prod-migrate`, etc.), which use `Gunicorn` and optimized Docker settings.
